# ZeroSoftwareStore Stream
_Keeps your software updated at all times trough the ZeroNet._

## How it works
The ZeroNet is a peer-to-peer network, which means that users are also servers, this requires the ZeroNet to store stuff Client-side.
By requesting a website, the ZeroNet protocol downloads a folder and stores the website in it, this folder will contain every file that's available on the site.
ZeroSoftwareStore Stream uses this protocol to get a folder containing program files, and in that way you can run the program in it without the need of installing or updating it.
